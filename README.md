1. Download and open all of the project file using a flutter compatible IDE.
2. I recomend IntelliJ IDEA
3. Get a AdMob App ID for iOS and Android
4. Follow the instructions on how to add the App ID. https://developers.google.com/admob/flutter

6. Add the InterstitialAd ID to the ***void _initAd(){}*** method.
7. Run the program using iOS or Android emulator


## I'm looking your CV (Curriculum Vitae), where can I find useful info about this project?
